How can safety signs be effectively used ?

\
By placing the appropriate safety signs at suitable
distances from the danger zone                              
\
By ensuring that the signs are not too big to cause
obstruction                                                
\
By making safety signs more colourful and bright.        
\
By reducing the distractions which safety signs may cause.
