In the 1970s, the American automotive industry faced the 
problem of a declining demand for large, gas consuming 
automobiles, which was the main type of auto produced by 
American companies.  The industry was unable to adjust quickly 
enough to changing consumer demand.  As a result, large numbers 
of American autoworkers lost their jobs.  The kind of 
unemployment experienced in this case was
\
cyclical unemployment
\
structural unemployment
\
frictional unemployment
\
demand-pull unemployment
\
supply-shock unemployment

The belief in gold and silver as a basic form of wealth was 
most associated with
\
The Capitalists
\
Karl Marx
\
The Physiocrats
\
The Mercantilists
\
The Monetarists
\
Gold and silver represent wealth to the mercantilist because it 
was through gold and silver that they, individually achieved 
wealth.

If income were distributed relatively equal among the people, 
Adam Smith would argue that
\
A greater balance would occur in the demand for goods and 
services thus increasing the wealth of a nation
\
Consumers would spend more of their income thus stimulate 
the general economic conditions
\
Consumers would fail to save enough of their income to 
provide enough funds for investment in capital and the 
economy would stagnate
\
The average person would be better off in the long-run
\
Adam Smith was a very polite man and never argued

An entrepreneur estimates that the addition of equally 
competent workers would affect the production of his product 
(suit cases) in the following way:

                  Worker       Total Product
                  ------       -------------
                    1                15
                    2                35
                    3                60
                    4                75

The worker at which diminishing returns is noticed and the 
marginal product of that worker are
\
Worker 1 and 15 units
\
Worker 2 and 35 units
\
Worker 3 and 25 units
\
Worker 4 and 15 units
\
Worker 4 and 75 units
\
Diminishing returns occurs where the marginal product of the 
additional worker hired first falls as compared to the 
previously hired worker.

The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests
\
when money income increases people buy more
\
when the price of one good increases other prices will 
probably increase
\
as a consumer consumes additional units of a given product 
the next unit always generates less satisfaction than the 
former
\
utility companies that are marginal shall diminish in size
\
as producers produce more output begins to diminish

Which of the following cannot cause a "change in the demand" 
for college textbooks?
\
a decrease in the jobs available to students
\
an increase in the price of textbooks
\
reducing the hours that the college library is open for 
study
\
increase in the level of government and private grants to 
students
\
more people decide that going to school is a waste of time
\
In Figure 10, the demand curve would shift to the left.  An 
"increase in the price of textbooks" would cause a change in 
the quantity demanded (Qd).  The price increase should cause a 
decrease in the Qd.  Only exogenous variables cause a change in 
the demand for a product.  The price of textbooks is an 
endogenous variable in the demand model.  When price changes a 
shift would occur along a given curve.

at the old Pe (Jan) a shortage would exist causing the Pe

\
at the old Pe (Jan) a shortage would exist causing the Pe

\
the new (June) Pe would be lower and the new Qe would be 
higher than January

the new (June) Pe would be higher and the new Qe would be

\
none of these

Both the D and S curves increased (shifted to the right), 
however the increase in supply was greater than the increase in 
demand thus the market price fell.

The "Benefits Received" philosophy of taxation
\
would work well in developing a tax to fight poverty
\
suggest all people should receive the same benefits
\
argues that welfare workers should pay taxes to fight 
poverty
\
is based on the idea that the people who primarily benefit 
from the way a particular tax revenue is spent by 
government should be the people who pay the tax.
\
is based on the idea that those who have the greatest 
benefits in a society should pay the greatest burden of the 
taxes.
\
The gasoline tax and social security tax are classic examples.

opportunity costs are decreasing as the production of a 
good increases
\
opportunity costs are increasing as the production of a 
good increases
\
opportunity costs are fixed as the production of a good 
increases
\
resources are of uniform quality
\
costs decrease as more of something is produced
\
Since resources have unequal abilities, and the expansion of 
output requires more inputs, inferior resources will cause 
costs to increase with output.

In Classical Economic Theory, a recession would be avoided by:

direct intervention by economists
\
direct intervention by government
\
spending more on public projects
\
interest rates falling causing demand to rise
\
all of the above
\
Falling interest rates would stimulated more investment and 
consumer spending in a classical model.

If the MPC increased between 1936 and 1946, economists would 
conclude
\
M decreased proportional to the MPC increase
\
M increased proportional to the MPC increase
\
M increased more than proportional to the MPC increase
\
exogenous events will have a less unstabilizing effect on 
NNP
\
a depression occurred between 1936 and 1946

When the marginal tax rate is less than the average tax rate
\
the tax system is likely progressive
\
the tax system is likely proportional
\
the tax system is likely regressive
\
the tax system is likely a negative tax
\
there is a likely unbalance of horizontal equity
\
When the marginal tax rate is less than the average, additional 
income will cause the tax bill to rise but the average tax rate 
will fall.

According to classical economists that adhere to the "quantity 
theory of money":
\
money is the most important variable that affects 
production, employment, and price
\
increasing the supply of money will only increase prices 
and decreasing the supply of money will only decrease price 
because velocity and transactions would not change
\
money does not affect anything at all
\
increasing or decreasing the supply of money will increase 
or decrease prices because velocity and transactions change 
frequently

Using the information provided below regarding the banking 
system's financial condition:

                      FED (Consolidated)
     ________________________________________________________

     Gold Certificate      $ 25B     Deposits of Banks  $100B
     U.S. Bonds            $100B     Treasury Deposits  $ 10B
     Loans to Banks        $ 25B     Federal Res. Notes $ 40B

              COMMERCIAL BANKS (Consolidated)
     ________________________________________________________

     Reserves              $100B     Demand Deposits    $500B
     U.S. Bonds            $200B     Loans from FED     $ 25B
     Loans Rec.            $225B

Which of the following is TRUE?
\
if the required reserve ratio is 20%, banks have the money 
creating potential of $100B
\
if the required reserve ratio is 20%, banks have the money 
creating potential of zero
\
if the FED purchases $10B in U.S. bonds from commercial 
banks, then the banks could create up to $20B in new money, 
assuming a required reserve ratio of 20%

A pyramid scheme that induces people to hold $5B more currency 
and less demand deposits and induces winners to put winnings in 
safety deposit boxes would:
\
cause banks to make more money by renting safety deposit 
boxes and increase their ability to lend money
\
cause banks to be short $2B in required reserves if the 
required reserve ratio is 20%
\
eventually cause the money supply to contract by $20B if 
the required reserve ratio is 20%
\
could be neutralized by the open-market selling of U.S. 
Bonds by the Fed

If the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to the 
Japanese yen, the comparison of the two countries GNP's 
\
would show the Japanese GNP higher
\
would show the U.S. GNP higher
\
would not change the relative GNP's
\
would cause both GNP's to rise
\
would cause both GNP's to fall
\
The more highly valued dollar will buy more yen.  Thus, any 
comparison of GNP's in a like currency will reduce the Japanese 
GNP relative to the U.S. GNP.

If the multiplier is 4, this implies that
\
when In increases 1, C increases by 3
\
when In increases 2, Y increases by 4
\
when In increases 3, C increases by 4
\
when In increases 4, Y increases by 9
\
\
Although Y will increase by 4 fold, C will increase only 3 fold 
since since I, itself, will accounts for one of the 4 fold 
increase.

if people attempt to save more, national employment will 
rise
\
if people attempt to protect themselves by saving more, it 
may result in an economic decline nationally.

Fiscal policy that is deliberately undertaken is discretionary

exists because each citizen owes over $5000 to the holders

at or near full employment by
\
spending more when the economy is in a recession
\
taxing more when the economy is in a recession
\
spending more when the economy is expanding too fast
\
taxing less when the economy is expanding too fast
\
wait, because the economy is always close to full 
employment

Many economists argued that the large deficits of the 1980's 
and the necessary borrowing by the federal government to 
finance then, would "crowd out" private investment since less 
money should be available to be loaned to private businesses. 
The actual experience indicates that private investment
\
increased rapidly since the deficits were lower than 
expected
\
fell slightly
\
increased slightly
\
increased rapidly since foreigners appeared to be injecting 
dollars into the U.S. financial markets
\
increased rapidly because classical economists were wrong 
about the crowding out effect

to the price change

If the quantity demanded for a product increases economists 
would expect
\
the price to increase
\
the demand to increase
\
the supply to increase
\
the price to decrease
\
None of these choices are consistent with the model of 
demand or supply.
\
Quantity demanded is an dependent variable in the demand and 
supply models.  It reacts to price changes.  It is not a causal 
or independent variable.

Mr. Smith drinks an alcoholic beverage.  After finishing the 
drink he is more intent than ever on having another.  An 
economist would suggest
\
that he is just having a good time but should call a taxi 
to get home.
\
that he is exhibiting the behavior we would expect in 
normal people as beverages are consumed.
\
that the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is being 
violated probably due to the distorting effect alcohol can 
have on the mind.
\
that he would probably pay less for the second drink than 
for the first.
\
Mr. Smith is confused...because he is a student in an 
economics class at a local college!
\
Alcohol may cause people to behave irrationally.

that exports must exceed imports for a nation to prosper. 
\
that communal property was central to economic growth 
\
that private property was a basic human right. 
\
that wealth was not fixed, but could be expanded by the 
stimulation of the productivity of labor. 
\
small markets were more conducive to the accumulation of 
capital by free people.

Mr. Smith's income in 1990 was $50,000.00 and his tax bill was 
$10,000.00.  In 1991, his income was $60,000.00 and his tax 
bill was $14,000.00.  Given that Mr. Smith's deductions, 
exemptions, and tax credits were the same in both years, what 
were Mr. Smith's marginal tax rate and average tax rate in 1991 
(answers are listed respectively):

The basic problem facing the federal social security program is 
\
that the productivity of American workers is rising faster 
than taxes.
\
that many Americans are delaying retirement because they 
are ill.
\
that more women are working today and are causing a greater 
burden on the system.
\
that for various reasons, since the 1940s, the number of 
people working for each retiree has fallen dramatically.
\
that new immigrants have overloaded the system.

Suppose the following items made up the average monthly market 
basket purchased for the Jones family in 1990:

               Item       Quantity    Price
              --------   ----------  -------
              Gasoline   50 gallons   $1.00
              Meat       10 pounds    $3.00
              Potatoes   20 pounds    $1.00

In 1991, with no change in the quality of gas, the price of gas 
increased to $1.10 per gallon.  The price of meat and potatoes 
stayed the same.  Assuming the family market basket choices and 
needs do not change, calculate the annual rate of inflation for 
this family.

Inflation is considered to be a serious economic problem 
because
\
it redistributes income and wealth.
\
it causes taxpayers to pay more taxes in real terms without 
politicians having to increase taxes.
\
it reduces saving rates.
\
it reduces investment in physical and human capital.
\
of all of the above.

In the 1970s, the American automotive industry faced the 
problem of a declining demand for large, gas consuming 
automobiles, which was the main type of auto produced by 
American companies.  The industry was unable to adjust quickly 
enough to changing consumer demand.  As a result, large numbers 
of American autoworkers lost their jobs.  The kind of 
unemployment experienced in this case was
\
cyclical unemployment
\
structural unemployment
\
frictional unemployment
\
demand-pull unemployment
\
supply-shock unemployment
